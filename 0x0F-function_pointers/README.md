# 0x0F. C - Function pointers
This directory contains programs written in C language for the ALX Software Engineering program. The programs demonstrate the use of function pointers in C programming language.

## Programs
Below is a list of the programs and a brief description of each:

- 0-print_name.c: a function that prints a name using function pointers.
- 1-array_iterator.c: a function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.
- 2-int_index.c: a function that searches for an integer in an array using a function pointer.
- 3-calc.h: a header file that contains all function prototypes and data structures used by the calculator program.
- 3-op_functions.c: a file that contains the arithmetic operation functions used by the calculator program.
- 3-get_op_func.c: a function that selects the correct function to perform the operation asked by the user.
- 3-main.c: the main function that runs the calculator program.
