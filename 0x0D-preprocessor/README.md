# 0x0D. C - Preprocessor

This directory contains examples of using the C preprocessor. The C preprocessor is a tool that is run before the C compiler, which processes and modifies the source code before compilation.

The examples in this directory demonstrate the following concepts:

- Defining and using macros
- Using the #include directive to include header files
- Using include guards to prevent multiple inclusion of header files
- Using the #ifdef, #ifndef, #endif, #else, and #elif directives for conditional compilation
## Files
The following files are included in this directory:

- 0-object_like_macro.h: Defines a macro named SIZE as an abbreviation for the token 1024.
- 1-pi.h: Defines a macro named PI as an abbreviation for the token 3.14159265359.
- 2-main.c: A program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from to standard output.
- 3-function_like_macro.h: Defines a function-like macro ABS(x) that computes the absolute value of a number x.
- 4-sum.h: Defines a function-like macro SUM(x, y) that computes the sum of two numbers x and y.
