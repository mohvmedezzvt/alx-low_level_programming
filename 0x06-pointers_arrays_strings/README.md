This folder contains C programs that demonstrate the use of pointers, arrays, and strings in C programming language. The main topics covered in this folder are:

- Pointers and arrays
- Pointers to pointers and multi-dimensional arrays
- Arrays of structures and pointers to structures
- String manipulation
## Files
The following files are included in this folder:

- 0-strcat.c	Concatenates two strings
- 1-strncat.c	Concatenates two strings with n bytes from src
- 2-strncpy.c	Copies a string up to n bytes
- 3-strcmp.c	Compares two strings
- 4-rev_array.c	Reverses the content of an array of integers
- 5-string_toupper.c	Changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase
- 6-cap_string.c	Capitalizes all words of a string
- 7-leet.c	Encodes a string into 1337
- 8-rot13.c	Encodes a string using rot13
- 100-print_number.c	Prints an integer
- 101-magic.c	Changes the value of an element in an array using a pointer
- 102-infinite_add.c	Adds two numbers stored in strings
- 103-print_buffer.c	Prints a buffer
## Requirements
All files in this folder were written in C and compiled on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`. They were compiled using `gcc` with the flags `-Wall, -Werror, -Wextra, and -pedantic`.
