# 0x13. C - More singly linked lists
This directory contains C programs and functions that demonstrate the use of singly linked lists in C programming. Singly linked lists are a common data structure used in computer science and are particularly useful for implementing dynamic data structures like stacks, queues, and hash tables.

## Files
The following programs and functions are included in this directory:

- lists.h: This is a header file that contains the function prototypes and structures used in the other programs.
- 0-print_listint.c: This program contains a function that prints all the elements of a listint_t singly linked list.
- 1-listint_len.c: This program contains a function that returns the number of elements in a listint_t singly linked list.
- 2-add_nodeint.c
This program contains a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a listint_t singly linked list.
- 3-add_nodeint_end.c: This program contains a function that adds a new node at the end of a listint_t singly linked list.
- 4-free_listint.c
This program contains a function that frees a listint_t singly linked list.
- 5-free_listint2.c: This program contains a function that frees a listint_t singly linked list and sets the head to NULL.
- 6-pop_listint.c: This program contains a function that deletes the head node of a listint_t singly linked list, and returns the head node's data.
- 7-get_nodeint.c: This program contains a function that returns the nth node of a listint_t singly linked list.
- 8-sum_listint.c
This program contains a function that returns the sum of all the data (integer) of a listint_t singly linked list.
- 9-insert_nodeint.c
This program contains a function that inserts a new node at a given position of a listint_t singly linked list.
- 10-delete_nodeint.c: This program contains a function that deletes a node at a given position of a listint_t singly linked list.
- 100-reverse_listint.c: This program contains a function that reverses a listint_t singly linked list.
